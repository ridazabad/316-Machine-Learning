With my niggas in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck you, pay me
Rolling deeper than Adele when we go out

If the ladies show up, then we show out
With my girl in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck me, baby
Leather seats so she wetter than a pool now
When that thing go up then she go down

This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type

Wood grain Nada, yes I'm the Baba
Don't rock Prada, what's a stylist
I'd rather make my clothes, merch by the boat load
Banana club popping, yep I'm super biased (true)
Tint so black, look like my complexion
Neo I'm the one like I had direction
Rims look like they were shipped from heaven
Trunk so big it could fit my reverend (yeah!)
And that nigga's pretty big
Engine so fast, every block is a trip
Baby girl wished that I copped the two seater
But I had to get five 'cause my niggas want to ride

With my niggas in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck you, pay me
Rolling deeper than Adele when we go out
If the ladies show up, then we show out
With my girl in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck me, baby
Leather seat so she wetter than a pool now
When that thing go up then she go down

This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
